# JANUS C Toolkit

## ABSTRACT

JANUS is a physical layer coding open-source promoted and developed by CMRE. It is freely distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3. The two primary purposes for JANUS are to announce the presence of a node and to establish the initial contact between dissimilar nodes, establishing this way an UW “lingua franca”.

## BUILDING and INSTALLING

Example code to build the code in the directory 'build' inside the JANUS source tree.  In this example the produced program will be installed in the directory local_install also located inside the source tree. Binaries will be compiled with debug option and allowed the prints for the plug-ins code.
